Step 5: Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service
Your business needs an EIN to identify your business to the IRS. This unique number is required when filing and paying taxes or when submitting payroll information and payments for your employees. If you need a business bank account (which we highly recommend you do), then an EIN would be required too.
You can obtain one
directly from the IRS or have Bizee obtain one for you as part of the Rhode Island LLC formation process.
Step 6: Create an Operating Agreement
An operating agreement serves as a type of "guidebook" elucidating the operational framework of your enterprise. Within an
LLC Operating Agreement
, crucial elements of your business structure are delineated, encompassing the process for decision-making, the distribution of business interests among members, and the protocols to be followed in the event of a member's departure from the company.
While certain states make it mandatory for businesses to possess such a document, there is no legal compulsion to possess a
Rhode Island LLC Operating Agreement
. However, it is advisable to still consider having one for your business.
