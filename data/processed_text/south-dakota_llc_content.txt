How To Guide
Step 1: Complete a South Dakota LLC Search and Choose a Business Name
To start the process, you’ll need a name for your LLC that’s unique and stands out, but you’ll want to make sure that it’s not being used by any other business or formed entity in the state. If you’re having trouble coming up with a name try using
Bizee’s Business Name Generator
. Additionally, adherence to specific naming guidelines is imperative, and a comprehensive understanding of these rules can be found on the
South Dakota Business Names page
.
Once you’ve chosen a name, you’ll need to make sure it’s available in South Dakota. To find out whether another company in the state is already using your preferred business name, use our tool to do a

Step 2: Provide an Official Business Address for Your LLC
Whether your business is situated in an office building, a residential setting for home-based operations, or any other physical location, every South Dakota LLC must have an assigned street address. While this address can be located outside of South Dakota, it's crucial to note that a P.O. Box is not an acceptable option by the state.
Step 3: Assign a Registered Agent
A Registered Agent is an individual who accepts official legal and tax communications and holds the responsibility of submitting reports to the South Dakota Secretary of State (SOS). Every South Dakota LLC is obligated to designate a Registered Agent.
This position can be filled by you, another manager in your business or a dedicated Registered Agent service. If your
South Dakota Registered Agent
is a person, they must have a physical street address in South Dakota and must be present during business hours to receive important documents on behalf of your business. In South Dakota, you appoint your Registered Agent when you file your Articles of Organization and formally create your business.
All of Bizee’s packages include Registered Agent service. It’s free for the first year and just $119 per year after that. We also provide you with access to our dashboard where you can easily view any document we've received on your behalf.

Step 5: Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service
An Employer Identification Number (EIN) is essential for IRS identification of your business. This number is used during tax filing, payroll submissions, and employee payments. Additionally, it's required to establish a business bank account. You can
acquire an EIN directly from the IRS
, or Bizee can assist in obtaining one as part of the South Dakota LLC formation procedure.
Step 6: Create an Operating Agreement
Consider an operating agreement as a valuable "manual" that elucidates your business's operational structure. Within an
LLC Operating Agreement
, crucial elements are mapped out, including the methodology for decision-making, the distribution of member ownership, and protocols for member departures from the company.
Although some states require businesses to have this document in place, you're not legally required to have an
