Why Create
a Mississippi
LLC?

business incentives
within the state of Mississippi that businesses can take advantage of, provided your LLC meets the specific criteria. For example, the
Minority Business Micro Loan Program
provides qualifying businesses with small loans up to the amount of $35,000.

How To Guide
Step 1: Complete a Mississippi LLC Search and Choose a Unique Business Name
To start the process, you’ll need a name for your LLC that’s unique and stands out, but you'll want to make sure that it's not being used by any other business or formed entity in the state. If you’re having trouble coming up with a name, try using Bizee’s
Business Name Generator
to brainstorm ideas. You'll also need to follow a few naming rules, which you can read about in detail on the
Mississippi Business Names
page.
Once you’ve chosen a name, you’ll need to make sure it’s available in Mississippi. To find out whether another corporation or company in the state is already using your preferred business name, use our tool to do a
business name search
. You can also carry out a name search within the Mississippi Secretary of State's website via their
business entity search
.

Step 2: Provide an Official Business Address for your LLC
Regardless of whether your business is in an office building, a home (if the company is run from a residence) or any other physical location, every Mississippi LLC must have a designated street address. It can be located outside the state of Mississippi, but it cannot be a P.O. Box.
Step 3: Assign a Registered Agent
A Registered Agent is someone who receives official legal and tax correspondence and is responsible for filing reports with the Mississippi Secretary of State (SOS). Every LLC in Mississippi is required to have a Registered Agent.
This position can be filled by you, another manager in your business or a dedicated Registered Agent service. If your
Mississippi Registered Agent
is a person, they must have a physical street address in Mississippi and must be present during business hours to receive important documents on behalf of your business. In Mississippi, you appoint your Registered Agent when you file your Certificate of Formation and formally create your business.
All of Bizee’s packages include Registered Agent service. It’s free for the first year and just $119 per year after that. We also provide you with access to our dashboard where you can easily view any document we've received on your behalf.

Step 4: File Your Certificate of Formation with the Mississippi Secretary of State (SOS)
Once you've gathered all the information for your Mississippi LLC, you’ll need to file your
Certificate of Formation
with the Mississippi Secretary of State.
Here’s what is typically included:
Name of your LLC
Principal address of the business
The primary purpose of the business
Name, address and contact information of the Registered Agent
Whether the LLC is will be member-managed or manager-managed
Names and signatures of all organizers
Your Certificate of Formation should be filed online with the Mississippi Secretary of State, via the
online business portal
. The
Mississippi LLC filing fee
is $50.
You only need to file your Certificate of Formation once, however all LLCs in Mississippi must file an annual report via
the online business service
once a year to remain compliant with the Secretary of State. There is no fee set by the MS Secretary of State for this service.

Step 5: Get an Employer Identification Number (EIN) from the Internal Revenue Service
You’ll need an
EIN
to identify your business to the IRS. You use this number when filing and paying taxes or when submitting payroll information and payments for your employees. An EIN is also required to open a business bank account.
You can obtain one
directly from the IRS, or you can have Bizee obtain one for you as part of the Mississippi LLC formation process.
Step 6: Create an Operating Agreement
An operating agreement is a kind of "instruction manual" that explains how you'll run your business. An
LLC Operating Agreement
will outline key components of your business - how decisions will be made, how the business is divided among members and what will happen if a member leaves the company.
Although some states require businesses to have this document in place, you're not legally required to have an
LLC Operating Agreement
in place to conduct business in Mississippi. We do recommend having one for your business nonetheless.
